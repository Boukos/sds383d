## Exercises

[You can find all the exercises here](exercises). I'll be adding more exercises as we proceed through the course.

You should post your code and solutions to GitHub. I strongly suggest using Latex -- you can edit my .tex files. If you don't already have a GitHub account, please [set one up](https://www.github.com) and learn how to use it. Please, send me the link.

If you're unfamiliar with github, here is a [basic guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) and here is a [slightly more in-depth guide](https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401)
